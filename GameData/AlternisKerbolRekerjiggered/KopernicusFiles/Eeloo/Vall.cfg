			description	= Vall is a small moon orbiting Eeloo at a very close distance. Its tidal interaction with its parent planet may have given rise to cryovolcanism on both bodies. When Vall was first discovered, it was thought to be almost as massive as Eeloo, and thus the system was classified as a double planet system.  After it was found that Vall was smaller and smaller than expected, and that there may be lots more objects like it, they had to reconsider whether or not it really should be called a planet or not. While the majority of the scientific community agreed that it should be classified as a moon instead, the very vocal public were all very angry at the idea of demoting "Poor Vall," because it seems they had kerbthropomorphized it and made it seem like it was something other than a non-living hunk of ice. In the end, the Kerbal Astronomical Union reclassified Vall as a moon. This is a decision that has made a lot of people unhappy and has been widely regarded as a "bad move."
