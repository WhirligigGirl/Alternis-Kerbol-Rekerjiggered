			description	= The Mun is a large, grey, spherical moon orbiting Jool. Like all Joolian moons, Mun is tidally locked. This means the Jool-facing side looks different from the far side, as the far side was exposed to hotter conditions for a longer period of time. It is one of the most visible objects in the sky, and along with Laythe it can be seen during night or day (depending on its phase). Telescopic observations of the Mun's surface shows a lot of craters marking what would otherwise be a smooth surface. What causes these craters is still a subject of great controversy in the scientific community. One group believes the Mun's craters are volcanic, while those who see the lack of any volcanic gasses vehemently suggest that the craters are caused by impacts. Whatever they are, they would certainly pose a challenge to land in.

			%description = Galeo is a small moon orbiting Meander. It is grey and telescope observations suggest it is heavily cratered. It is possible, however unlikely, that the grey areas are in fact seas. This is not likely to be the case. The moon is named after the scientist who discovered the moons of Jool: Galeo Kerman.
