			description = Jool is the largest object in the Kerbin sky. It is our parent body, around which the local system revolves. It is the only planet made from gas instead of solids, and is the largest planet in the solar system. Its blue bands are known to be rapidly swirling clouds of ammonia and methane, swirled around by the rapid rotational speed of Jool. It is thought that Jool is made up of the gas left over from the formation of the Sun. Jool's magnetic field is surprisingly weak for a planet of its size and spin. It was long thought that Jool was the center of the universe. Embarrassingly recent discoveries on the nature of gravitation were able to determine that, in fact, Jool was only the center of the major moon orbits. In fact, Jool and the other planets orbit the Sun.
